## Introductio to C++

C++ is a modern, powerful language.

- Functional programming
- Procedural programming
- Object oriented programming

Code written in C++ is usually faster than equivalent code written in any other language.

The type safety, which is built into the language, enables developers to write stable code and catch many errors at compile time.
