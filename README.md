## Introductio to C++

C++ is a modern, powerful language.

- Functional programming
- Procedural programming
- Object oriented programming

Code written in C++ is usually faster than equivalent code written in any other language.

The type safety, which is built into the language, enables developers to write stable code and catch many errors at compile time.

### History of C++

- 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup start to work on "C with classes" in Bell Labs
- 1983, "C with classes" renamed as C++
- 1985, C++ 1.0 released
- 1989, C++ 2.0 released
- 1998, First ISO standard C++ 98 released
- 2003, C++ 3.0 released
- 2011, C++ 11 released (Major revision)
- 2020, C++ 20 released

### Futures of C++

- Object Oriented
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Rich Library of functions
- Compiler based
- Portable language

### Why C++

- C++ is an object-oriented programming language
- C++ use multi-paradigm programming approach
- C++ provides the user complete control over memory management

### Comments

- Comments improve the readability of the code and makes the code more clear and understandable
- C++ supports two comment styles
    + Single line comment: Syntax: ```//``` (For eg: ```//This is a single line comment```)
    + Multi line comment: Syntax: ```/*  */``` (For eg: ```/*This is a multi line comment*/```)
    
### Identifiers

- Identidiers are the names given to class, variables and methods
    + Rule 1: Identidiers manes can start with an alphabet, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign and followed by alphabets or numbers
    + Rule 2: Identifiers are case sensitive and have no maximum length
- Valid Examples: `userName`, `user_name`, `_sys_var1`, `$currency`
- Invalid Examples: `1username`, `user name`
